# 3D Tile Reference: Visual Style Guide

This folder contains reference images and instructions for 3D asset creation and rendering for the Settlers from Catan project.

## Reference Image

- **File:** 3d-hex-tile.png
- **Description:** Use this image as the primary visual reference for all 3D hex tile rendering. It demonstrates the desired low-poly, stylized look, color palette, and tile clarity.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Visual Consistency:**
   - All 3D hex tiles and terrain features must match the style, color, and clarity of the reference image.
   - Use low-poly models and vivid, distinct colors for each terrain type.
   - Ensure clear borders between hex tiles.
2. **Asset Creation:**
   - Create separate models for each terrain type (forest, mountain, field, desert, water, etc.) and special features (buildings, ships, bridges, ruins).
   - All features must fit within a single hex tile and not overlap adjacent tiles.
3. **Rendering:**
   - Use an isometric or slightly angled top-down camera.
   - Apply simple lighting with minimal shadows, as in the reference.
4. **Review:**
   - Render a test section (5–10 tiles) with all major terrain types and at least one special feature for feedback before proceeding with the full board.

## File Organization

- Place all future reference images and 3D asset renders in this `specs/assets/` directory.
- Keep this README updated with new references and instructions as the visual style evolves.
